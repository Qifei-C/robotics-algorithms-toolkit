# Particle Filter SLAM

This project implements a Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithm using a particle filter and LiDAR data.

## üöÄ Core Components

*   **Particle Filter**: A particle filter for robot localization.
*   **Occupancy Grid Mapping**: A module for creating and updating an occupancy grid map of the environment.
*   **LiDAR Processing**: Utilities for processing LiDAR data, including point cloud transformation and ray casting.
*   **SLAM Implementation**: The core SLAM algorithm that integrates the particle filter and mapping components.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

To run the project, you can use the provided scripts to perform SLAM on a dataset, such as the KITTI dataset. The output will be a map of the environment and the trajectory of the robot.
