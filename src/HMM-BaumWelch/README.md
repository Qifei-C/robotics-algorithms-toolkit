# Hidden Markov Model with Baum-Welch Algorithm

This project provides a Python implementation of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), including the Forward-Backward algorithm and the Baum-Welch algorithm for parameter learning.

## üöÄ Core Components

*   **HMM Implementation**: The core HMM class that supports defining initial probabilities, transition probabilities, and emission probabilities.
*   **Forward-Backward Algorithm**: Functions to compute the likelihood of observations and backward probabilities.
*   **Baum-Welch Algorithm**: An implementation of the Baum-Welch algorithm for learning HMM parameters from observed sequences.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

To use this project, you can define your HMM parameters (initial, transition, and emission probabilities) and then use the provided functions to compute probabilities, or train the HMM using the Baum-Welch algorithm on observed data.
