# PPO for Bipedal Walker Control

This project implements the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to train a bipedal walker robot in a simulated environment.

## üöÄ Core Components

*   **PPO Algorithm**: The core implementation of the PPO algorithm, including an actor-critic architecture, a clipped surrogate objective, and Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE).
*   **Bipedal Walker Environment**: A wrapper for the bipedal walker environment from a library like OpenAI Gym.
*   **Training and Evaluation**: Scripts for training the PPO agent, evaluating its performance, and visualizing the learned policy.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

To run the project, you can use the provided scripts to train a PPO agent to control the bipedal walker. After training, you can evaluate the agent's performance and visualize its walking gait.
